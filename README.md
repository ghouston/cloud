# cloud

cloud is a project from the [Bham! Game Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Bham-Game-Developers/) for the month of June 2015.  The project is incomplete.

The plan was to make a cloud game where you controll a cloud in a sandbox world.  As the cloud you can help or hurt the environment and npcs in the game.

At this time, there is not much to see.  A simple placehold for a cloud and a plant exist in the environment.  The cloud can water the plant.  Too much water will kill the plant.

# development team notes

Do not edit the Master scene until you let everyone else know that you are working on it. Let them all know when you are finished.
